# Summary

tangram is an open research framework for ADS-B and Mode S flight surveillance data that originated as a side project for detecting turbulence. It has potential for various real-time aviation research topics such as GNSS jamming detection, aviation weather monitoring, emission analysis, and airport performance monitoring.

The system consists of a JavaScript-based web application and a backend based on Python or Rust when performance is crucial. The web application is designed to be modular, allowing users to add their own plugins for data processing and analysis. The backend is responsible for data collection, storage, and processing, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and interacting with the data.

The whole framework is designed to be extensible, allowing researchers to develop and integrate their own plugins for specific research needs. This modularity enables the community to contribute to the platform, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing.

# Statement of need

The world of aviation involves many stakeholders producing a vast amount of data, but most of it is not publicly available for confidentiality and security reasons. Research in aviation is also often limited by the availability of data, but this has evolved in the past decade thanks to the introduction of open data initiatives [@eurocontrol_rd] [@nilsson_swedish_2023]. ADS-B and Mode S are technologies that allow aircraft to broadcast their position and other flight parameters, making it possible to collect real-time data on air traffic. Such data has been widely used for various research purposes, such as studying flight patterns [@olive_training_2025], estimating aircraft emissions [@seymour_fuel_2020] or monitoring air traffic performance [@schultz_predictive_2021].

ADS-B is not encrypted, and it is very easy to build a decoder to receive and decode the data with software-defined radio solutions. This has favoured the emergence of various open-source projects and tools for working with ADS-B data, such as dump1090, and platforms like The OpenSky Network [@opensky2014], a non-profit initiative that provides open access to real-time and historical air traffic data, which grants free access to researchers to study various aspects of aviation.

Most research initiatives and proofs of concept based on ADS-B data are limited to the use of historical data [@olive_traffic_2019]. However, the potential impact of such research depends on the possibility to adapt the algorithms to real-time data. The tangram framework aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform for real-time data collection and analysis, enabling researchers to conduct experiments and develop new algorithms in a more efficient manner.

# Core structure of the framework

The tangram framework consists of a suite of independent components that can be combined to create a powerful and flexible system, as illustrated on \autoref{core-structure}. The web application is built upon the vite framework, and consists of a series of Vue plugins that provide a module architecture for the frontend.

![Core structure of the framework](../docs/screenshot/tangram_diagram.pdf){#core-structure}

The interaction between the frontend and backend is based on both a REST API and a WebSocket connection. The REST API (the `tangram` application) is used for data retrieval and management, while the WebSocket connection (through the `channel` executable) allows for real-time communication between the frontend and backend.

The backend is responsible for data collection, storage, and processing. All the components communicate through a Redis pub/sub system which allows for efficient data exchange between components and real-time updates.

: List of backend components \label{components}

| **Backend component** | **Description**                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `jet1090`             | decode Mode S and ADS-B messages             |
| `planes`              | maintain a state vector table of aircraft    |
| `trajectory`          | get the history of data for a given aircraft |
| `tangram`             | REST API for data retrieval and management   |
| `channel`             | WebSocket connection for real-time updates   |

The most important components of the backend are listed in \autoref{components} and presented in more detail in the following sections. The Redis pub/sub is not detailed below as it is a standard component used key-in-hand.

## jet1090

`jet1090` (<https://mode-s.org/jet1090>) is a Rust-based ADS-B decoder that can be used to decode ADS-B messages from a variety of sources, including software-defined radio devices. It is designed to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications. The decoder can be used to decode ADS-B messages from a variety of sources, including software-defined radio devices and network streams such as those provided by commercial ADS-B receivers.

![The table view of `jet1090` in the terminal](../docs/screenshot/jet1090.png){#jet1090}

`jet1090` is comparable to the historical `dump1090` decoder (<https://github.com/antirez/dump1090>), but it is designed to include additional features such as the ability to decode Mode S messages, the support for multiple input sources, and for more output formats. The decoding logic is based on the Python decoder `pyModeS` [@sun_pymodes_2020] but adapted to Rust for performance reasons.

## planes

`planes` is a Python-based component that maintains a state vector table of aircraft. It is responsible for tracking the position and other parameters of aircraft in real-time. The component uses the data provided by `jet1090` to update the state vector table and provide real-time information about the aircraft.

A state vector table is a data structure (similar to what is displayed on \autoref{jet1090}) that contains the latest information about all the parameters of the aircraft. This is necessary because all ADS-B messages do not provide all the parameters of the aircraft at once. In particular the position, the speed, the track angle and the identification all come in different messages. Having the most recent information along all the possible features is usually enough to display the aircraft on a map.

## trajectory

`trajectory` is a Python-based component that provides a history of data for a given aircraft. It is responsible for storing and retrieving historical data about the aircraft's position and other parameters. The component uses the data stored by the Redis system and reformat it to be used by the frontend in a more standard JSON-like format. This is useful to be able to display the trajectory of an aircraft on a map, as well as to provide historical data for plotting, e.g. altitude, speed, vertical rate, etc.

## tangram REST API

The `tangram` component is a Python-based REST API that provides data retrieval and management capabilities. It is responsible for handling requests from the frontend and providing the necessary data for visualization and analysis. The API is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing researchers to add their own endpoints and functionality as needed.

Basic endpoints provided by the API include the data from `trajectory` and `planes`. Other endpoints are provided to facilitate the use of other data such as meteorological data through `fastmeteo` (<https://github.com/open-aviation/fastmeteo>). Since the component is based on FastAPI, it also possible to dynamically add new endpoints to the API at the plugin level. This allows researchers to create their own endpoints for specific research needs, such as custom data processing or analysis.

## channel

The `channel` (<https://github.com/emctoo/channel>) component is a Rust-based WebSocket connection that makes the bridge between the frontend and the Redis pub/sub system. It is responsible for providing real-time updates from and to the frontend.

For instance, state vectors updates from the `planes` component are sent on the Redis pub/sub and the `channel` tool listens to the channel before sending the data to the frontend through a WebSocket. Conversely, the bounding box of the map is sent from the frontend to the `channel` component, which then sends it on the Redis pub/sub system. For example, the `planes` component listens to this channel and updates the state vector table accordingly.

# The plugin system in tangram

The tangram system is designed to be modular and extensible. Researchers can easily implement particular functionalities by creating their own plugins, both at the backend level and at the frontend level.

A backend plugin is usually an executable or a Python module which will potentially:

- listen to a Redis channel;
- access private data or services requiring authentication;
- postprocess and enrich data;
- share resulting information on a Redis channel or on a REST endpoint.

A frontend plugin will usually be a Vue component which will potentially:

- add HTML elements to the web application (in the navigation bar or in the side bar);
- capture user interactions (e.g. mouse clicks, keyboard events);
- send requests to the backend (e.g. through the REST API or WebSocket);
- display data on the map (e.g. by adding markers, drawing lines, etc.)

Example plugins are provided in the `tangram` repository, including a plugin for visualizing the location of Mode S receivers, including route information to an aircraft, or for visualizing wind fields at a given altitude.

# Potential applications

The tangram framework has been thought to display ADS-B data on a map, in a similar fashion to the OpenSky Network or FlightRadar24, and to enrich it to include extra visualisation features based on algorithms published by the authors in the literature: turbulence detection [@olive_turbulence_2020], GNSS jamming detection [@felux_impacts_2024], anomaly detection [@zhao_incremental_2021], airspace occupancy metrics or aircraft trajectory prediction [@vos_transformer_2024].

The modularity of the framework allows for a wide range of other applications: the architecture and the frontend could be for instance extended to displaying ships broadcasting data on a similar protocol named AIS, or serve as a basis for visualising the output of real-time simulation tools which are commonly advertised in the literature.
