# Contribute to tangram

We aim to provide a quality codebase with documentation, but expect that you will find bugs and issues, and hope you will also imagine very creative plugins.

We welcome contributions to the project, whether it is code, documentation, or bug reports.

## Bug reports

Please file bug reports on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/open-aviation/tangram/issues).

When filing a bug report, please include the following information:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected and actual behaviour
- Any relevant logs or error messages
- Your environment (OS, browser, etc.)

## Bug fixes and contributions

If you want to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Make your changes and commit them with a clear message
4. Push your changes to your forked repository
5. Create a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository
6. Include a clear description of your changes and why they are needed
7. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and passes all tests
8. If your changes are related to a specific issue, reference that issue in your pull request description

## Plugins

If you want to share a plugin you have developed, please start by sharing a preview in the [Discussions](https://github.com/open-aviation/tangram/discussions)

## Style guide

We do not want to be too strict about the coding standards, but we expect that you will follow the general style guides of the rest of the codebase. Ensure your contribution doesn't reformat existing code unnecessarily, as this can make it harder to review changes.

Please take into account the `.editorconfig` file in the root of the repository, which defines the coding style for the project. You can find more information about EditorConfig [here](https://editorconfig.org/) and install plugins for your favourite editor.
