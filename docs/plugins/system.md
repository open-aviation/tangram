# System Plugin

The `tangram_system` plugin provides a background service that monitors and broadcasts server metrics like CPU load, RAM usage, and uptime. These metrics are displayed in the frontend UI.

## How It Works

1. The plugin's `pyproject.toml` registers its `plugin` object via the [`tangram.plugins` entry point](./backend.md).
2. This `plugin` object uses the [`@plugin.register_service()`][tangram.Plugin.register_service] decorator to mark the `run_system` function as a background service.
3. When `tangram serve` starts, the core framework discovers and runs the `run_system` service.
4. It publishes these metrics as JSON payloads to the `to:system:update-node` Redis channel.
5. The core `tangram` frontend is subscribed to the `system` WebSocket channel. The `channel` service forwards these Redis messages to the UI, where components like `SystemInfo.vue` update to display the live data.
