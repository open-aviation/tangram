# Jet1090 Plugin

The `tangram_jet1090` plugin is the primary tool for integrating live Mode S and ADS-B data into the `tangram` framework. It processes raw aviation surveillance data from a `jet1090` instance and makes it available for real-time visualization and historical analysis.

## Overview

This plugin consists of:

- **A background service** (`planes`) to maintain a real-time state of all visible aircraft.
- **A REST API endpoint** (`/data/{icao24}`) to fetch raw message history for a specific aircraft.
- **A frontend widget** to display a placeholder in the UI.

## `planes` Service

The `planes` service is the core of the real-time functionality. It is a Rust-based component, wrapped with PyO3 for integration into the Python ecosystem.

- **Continuous Tracking**: It subscribes to the `jet1090` Redis channel to receive decoded aircraft messages.
- **State Vector Maintenance**: It maintains a comprehensive in-memory view of the current air traffic situation by collecting and processing state vectors for all active aircraft. A state vector is a data structure containing the latest known information for each aircraft parameter (position, altitude, speed, etc.), as this data arrives in separate messages.
- **Client-Specific Filtering**: The service listens for bounding box updates from each connected frontend client. It filters the aircraft data for each client, sending only the aircraft visible within their map view.
- **Data Publishing**: Once per second, it publishes the filtered state vectors to a dedicated Redis channel for each client (e.g., `to:streaming-<client_id>:new-data`), which are then relayed to the browser via the WebSocket `channel` service.

## Configuration

To use this plugin, you must have a running `jet1090` instance publishing data to Redis. You can also configure the plugin in your `tangram.toml`:

```toml
[core]
plugins = ["tangram_jet1090"]

[plugins.tangram_jet1090]
# The Redis channel that jet1090 is publishing to.
jet1090_channel = "jet1090"
# How long (in seconds) to keep an aircraft in the state vector table
# after its last message.
history_expire = 20
```
